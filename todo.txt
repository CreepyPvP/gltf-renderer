    Screen borders
    Anti flicker term
    Ghosting (depth rejection?)
    1 Pixel ghosting

    Cleanup / basic optimization


Light probes + irradiance caching

Specular textures
Roughness textures
Occulsion textures

Shader managment

Animations
Skinning

Better resource managment here (also store names somewhere)

GL_TRIANGLES hardcoded

Profiling

Screenspace reflections
