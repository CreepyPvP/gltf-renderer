Antialiasing
    Fix blurring (Adaptive blend factor)
    Screen borders
    Anti flicker term
    Ghosting (depth rejection?)
    1 Pixel ghosting

    (Maybe try halton sequence for jitter?)
    (Try halton offset for sampling color buffer)

    Cleanup / basic optimization


Light probes + irradiance caching

Occulsion textures

Shader managment

Animations
Skinning
Alpha blending

Better resource managment here (also store names somewhere)

GL_TRIANGLES hardcoded

Profiling

Screenspace reflections
